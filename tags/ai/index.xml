        <description>&lt;p&gt;It may or may not be common knowledge that I have a background in accounting. In a former life I was responsible for running the accounting function of my workplace including taxation, financial reporting, chart of accounts, etc. I loved the accounting and the maths but not so much the job itself which is how I found myself returning to university in my late twenties to study software engineering. I&amp;rsquo;ve always thought this background gives me a slightly different perspective on software engineering as it relates to business. I consider the return on investment (ROI) of every line of code written (even every comment). There needs to be value to the business in what we do otherwise it&amp;rsquo;s just waste. Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, I&amp;rsquo;m an engineer through and through but it&amp;rsquo;s the business that keeps the lights on and ultimately we are bound to that bottom line whether we like it or not.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
