        <description>&lt;p&gt;If you release software with any reasonable cadence, it&amp;rsquo;s almost inevitable you will end up using a feature flag system of one sort or another. There always comes the time when engineering wants to decouple from the release cycle of the Go To Market (GTM) team and with good reason. The GTM team is slower and more traditional. They want to announce big &amp;ldquo;drops&amp;rdquo; and send out the marching band to showcase all the cool new stuff you can do in a process that can take months to orchestrate whereas we prefer to deploy more frequently in small increments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
